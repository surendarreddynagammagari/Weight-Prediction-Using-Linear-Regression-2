# Weight-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression-2
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict a person's weight based on their height, age, and exercise level using synthetic healthcare data.

## Dataset
- Synthetic dataset generated with NumPy
- Features:
  - Height (cm)
  - Age (years)
  - Exercise Level (Low, Medium, High)
- Target: Weight (kg)

## Model
- Supervised Learning: Linear Regression
- Framework: scikit-learn
- Evaluation Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

##  Results
- The model achieved a low MSE, indicating strong performance
- A scatter plot was used to visualize Actual vs Predicted weight

##  Reflection
This project helped me:
- Practice supervised regression modeling
- Work with real-world-style healthcare features
- Understand the impact of encoding and feature engineering
- Apply model evaluation techniques like MSE and visualization
